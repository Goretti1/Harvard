    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>This is my very first webpage. I am excited to learn. Please, encourage me. I believe that by joining this community of achievers, I will become an excellent programmer who will change the world for the better. Now, here is a list of the things I'm
        going to learn this week:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First Item</li>
        <li>Second Item</li>
        <li>Third Item</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In addition to the list above, I'll also do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>I'll solve this issue</li>
            <li>I'll handle that</li>
        </ul>
